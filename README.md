# CAUTION: If you're trying to downgrade to a lower OS version, you need to download the Fastboot file and follow the How to Flash instructions. OTA will not work for downgrading.

# Flashing Instructions

* Set up your computer for flashing

* Download the fastboot tool from the Android SDK Platform-Tools package
Add it to your path so the flash scripts can find it
Connect your Essential phone to your computer with a USB cable
Enable unlocking
Before you can flash a new image, ensure Developer options are enabled and OEM unlocking is turned on. To do this:

* Tap Settings, then tap System > About phone
Scroll to the bottom of the page, then tap Build number multiple times until you see the pop-up message “You are now a developer” (It usually takes seven taps)
Go back one screen to System, then tap Developer options
Find the option: OEM Unlocking and turn it on
Fastboot mode
Put your Essential Phone into fastboot mode by doing either of the following:

* Use the ADB tool packaged above to run the command: adb reboot bootloader
Reboot your phone while holding the Volume-down button
Unlock your bootloader
NOTE: Installing the factory image will erase all information from your device. So remember to backup your phone before continuing.

* Run the command: fastboot flashing unlock
* Press the Volume-down button to navigate to the YES option, then press the Power button to confirm
Flash your factory image

* Download the factory image to your computer
Unzip the downloaded file
Go to where you unzipped the images
For Linux / Mac OS X - Run the command: flashall.sh
For Windows - Run the command: flashall.bat
Relock your bootloader (Only if you are on stock)
After flashing, it’s a good idea to relock your bootloader for security.

* Go back to fastboot mode
Run the command: fastboot flashing lock

# Before Sideloading
* Caution: Before updating, backup any personal data on your device—so you can recover it if you encounter an issue.

* And Sideloading is for OTA, only! If you're trying to downgrade to a lower OS version, download the Fastboot file and follow the How to Flash instructions.

* Some users have reported issues when flashing or sideloading using a USB 2.0 cable. The cable included with PH-1 is USB 2.0 and is primarily intended for charging. If you're flashing or sideloading PH-1, we recommend using a high-quality, spec-compliant USB 3.0 (or higher) cable.

* To sideload a device using the image below, you’ll need the latest [ADB tool](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html). Don't forget to either add adb to your PATH environment variable or change into the directory containing the executable.

* Also, set up USB access for your device, as described in [Run Apps on a Hardware Device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device.html).

* Finally, check to see if there’s a pending OTA update for your device. Tap Settings > About phone > System updates, then tap Check for update. If your system is up-to-date, you can continue with the sideload. If not, update your device before continuing.

# How to Sideload (for OTA only):
* Download the appropriate update image to your computer
* Verify the checksum of the image. The OTA mechanism has a built-in validation feature, but verifying will save you some time if the file is incomplete. The last portion of the filename is the first 8 digits of its SHA-256 checksum; the full SHA-256 checksum is also shown next to the download link.
* Make sure USB debugging is enabled, then execute: adb reboot recovery
* If you're unable to use ADB to reboot into recovery, you can use the key combination for your device. To get into Fastboot, press Volume-Down + Power buttons. For Recovery mode, press Volume-Up + Power buttons.
* Then, navigate to the Recovery option by pressing the Volume-Down button. Once Recovery is highlighted, press the Power button to confirm.
## Your device is now in Recovery mode. An Android logo with red exclamation mark should appear on screen.
* Hold the Power button, then press the Volume-Up button one time. When the menu appears, select Apply update from ADB.
* Run the following command: adb devices. Then check that your device shows up with “sideload” next to its name
* Run the following command: adb sideload ota_file.zip where ota_file.zip is the name of the file you downloaded and verified
* Once the update finishes, select Reboot system now to reboot your phone
## For security, you should disable USB debugging when the device is not being updated.

# How to Flash (for Fastboot only):
## Set up your computer for flashing
* Download the fastboot tool from the [Android SDK Platform-Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html) package
* Add it to your path so the flash scripts can find it
* Connect your Essential phone to your computer with a USB cable
## Enable unlocking
### Before you can flash a new image, ensure Developer options are enabled and OEM unlocking is turned on. To do this:
* Tap Settings, then tap System > About phone
* Scroll to the bottom of the page, then tap Build number multiple times until you see the pop-up message “You are now a developer” (It usually takes seven taps)
* Go back one screen to System, then tap Developer options
* Find the option: OEM Unlocking and turn it on
## Fastboot mode
### Put your Essential Phone into fastboot mode by doing either of the following:
